			<div className="about-box">
				<p>Two years ago I began learning programming to better understand logic and mathematics.</p>
				<p>I started learning Python because it was a recommended first language and later I could use it for machine learning and data analysis.</p>
				<p>As I was learning Python,  it became clear that Python did a lot for me. That lead me to learning C++ to understand the lower-level logic and have better control of my programs.</p>
				<p>Currently I am learning Web Development to make websites. I am in the process of learning Javascript, HTML, CSS, Typescript and React.</p> 
				<p>On Github you can find all of my projects and I have chosen to show a few of them here with a summary.</p>
				<p> I think consistency is necessary for success. Each day I learn mathematics and algorithms, write code for projects and write a small program in Javascript, Python or C++. I think it's good for consistency to be accountable, so I tweet each day what I have done. </p>
