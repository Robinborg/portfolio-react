			<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>I am a self-taught programmer. 
				The first language I learned was Python, then some C++ and now
			   Javascript & React, HTML and CSS.
					My goal is to be a data scientist. Before getting into Data Science I want to work as a programmer or web developer. To build

				up an intuition of how programs and algorithms function.
			</p>
				<p>
					My days are focused on learning Discrete Mathematics and Calculus, Data Structures and Algorithms, and working on my projects on Github.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can follow my progress on Twitter
